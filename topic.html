      <h1>JSON</h1>
      <h2>What is JSON?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JSON stands for <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>N</strong>otation</li>
        <li>JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format</li>
        <li>JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand(as said by many)</li>
        <li>JSON is language independent *</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="help-text">
        <p>*<br />
          JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only.<br />
          Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language.

      <p>
        JSON is easy for humans as well as machines to edit.
        It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
        JSON is a text format that is completely language independent (any language can be used to phrase data into json format) but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers
        of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
        These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

      <h2>History of JSON</h2>
      <p>
        JSON grew out of a need for stateful, real-time server-to-browser communication protocol without using browser plugins such as Flash or Java applets, the dominant methods used in the early 2000s.
        <sup><a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/JSON.html">[2]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Douglas Crockford was <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs">[3]</a></sup> the first to specify and popularize the JSON format.
        The acronym was coined at State Software, a company co-founded by Crockford,
        Chip Morningstar and Robert F. Napiltonia in April 2001 and funded by Tesla Ventures.
      </p>
      <aside id="structures">
        <p>
          Two structures on which JSON is built are :
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is known as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.</li>
            <li>An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.</li>
          </ol>
      </aside>
      <p>
        These are universal data structures.
        Virtually it is supported by all mordern programming languages such as python, ruby, c, c++, c#, java, and many more! in one form or other.
        It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.
        <sup><a href="http://json.org/">[4]</a></sup>

        The other technologies that were used prior to the invention of json were

        <ul>
          <li>xml</li>
          <li>flash by Adobe</li>
          <li>java applets</li>
          <li>... and the list goes on</li>
        </ul>
      <p>So i have put together the comparison between json and the most commmonly used technology named XML</p>

      <section id="argument">
        <h2>The Argument</h2>
        The biggest argument for JSON is its direct mapping to programming language objects.
        While this may seem minor in comparison to the arguments for XML outlined above,
        it is in fact a major factor contributing to the choice of JSON over XML.

      <section id="future">
        <h2>The Future(Prediction)</h2>
        If the future of JSDON is predicted, it looks like JSON wins but as the technology is evolving
        every day and it can not be said that it is permanent and no better technology can come which deffeats JSON
        Moreover This can be said for XML too the future is in consistant!
